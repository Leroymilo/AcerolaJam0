A turn based survival/strategy game where the character must flee the Chaos that destroyed their village.

Use the arrow keys to move, you'll need machetes to go through Jungle, and Ropes to climb Mountains or Torches to go through Caves. Do not let the Chaos catch you.

Made with Godot 4, with absolutely no artistic talent.
