elf_neutral : It finally happened... The War Between Gods has concluded. But it's the God of Chaos and Entropy who won...
elf_neutral : As an Elf, a creature of Order and Regularity, I stand low chances of surviving a world without my God.
elf_neutral : The Pure Chaos created from the God's victory is about to destroy the city I live in.
elf_neutral : I must flee to survive, I have to head east, through the mountain range.
elf_neutral : I hope my torches will last long enough for me to cross the cave system...
help : Use the arrow keys to move. Do not let the Pure Chaos catch up to you!
help : Walking into a Mountain Cave tile will consume 1 Torch charge (shown on the left).
